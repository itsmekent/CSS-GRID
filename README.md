# CSS-GRID

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex grid-based designs by dividing a page into rows and columns. It provides control over item positioning, sizing, and alignment, making it ideal for building responsive and structured layouts.

# Product Page 

Before, Flexbox was used for the product cards, offering a flexible but limited layout with automatic item wrapping and no control over columns. After switching to CSS Grid, the layout became more structured, automatically adjusting the number of columns based on container size, with each column at least 280px wide but able to grow, providing a cleaner and more responsive design.

# Team Page 

Before, the Team Cards section used Flexbox, which provided a responsive layout but lacked control over the number of columns or item behavior on different screen sizes. After switching to CSS Grid, the cards now adjust automatically into as many columns as fit, with a minimum width, ensuring a consistent and polished layout across all screen sizes.

# Profile Page 

Before, the Profile Cards section used Flexbox, offering a flexible layout but lacking control over the number and width of columns, especially on smaller screens. After switching to CSS Grid, the profiles now adjust automatically based on the container size, ensuring even distribution, responsiveness, and a visually appealing, easy-to-maintain layout across various screen sizes.

**Overall Advantages of Switching to CSS Grid:**

- **Responsiveness:** CSS Grid automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the container's width, ensuring fewer columns on smaller screens and more columns on larger screens.

- **Control:** Unlike Flexbox, which operates along a single axis (row or column), CSS Grid offers two-dimensional control (both rows and columns), making it ideal for complex layouts like card designs.

- **Consistency:** CSS Grid ensures a more consistent and maintainable layout across various screen sizes, helping create a clean, professional design.

Switching to CSS Grid offers a more flexible, scalable, and modern approach to layout design, making it a superior choice for these sections.
